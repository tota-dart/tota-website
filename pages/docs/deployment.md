# Deployment

Tota creates static files that you can host anywhere, but provides a seamless, single-command deployment strategy to some preferred hosting providers:

```bash
tota deploy
```

## Host on Netlify

Netlify provides a global CDN, continuous deployment, automatic HTTPS, a pleasant UI and CLI tool, and quite a generous free plan.

Learn how to [deploy to Netlify](/docs/deployment/netlify).
