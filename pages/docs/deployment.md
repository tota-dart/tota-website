# Deployment

Tota creates static files that you can host anywhere, but provides a seamless, single-command deployment strategy to some preferred hosting providers:

```bash
tota deploy
```

## Host on Netlify

Netlify offers a CDN, automatic HTTPS, continuous deployment, a pleasant UI and CLI tool, as well as a generous free plan.
